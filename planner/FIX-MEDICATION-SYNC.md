# Fix: Medication Instance State Synchronization

## Problem
When marking medications as complete or skip in HomeView, they weren't moving to the completed section at the bottom of the list. The medication instances weren't syncing their state with the original medication data.

## Solution
Added state synchronization in the `generateMedicationInstances()` method to sync the instance state with the original medication:

```swift
// In ItemsListView.swift, line 244-246
// Sincronizar el estado con el medicamento original
instance.isCompleted = medication.isCompleted
instance.isSkipped = medication.isSkipped
```

This matches the implementation for habits, ensuring that when a medication is marked as complete/skip, all its instances reflect that state and move to the completed section.

## Testing
1. Create a medication from the Medications tab
2. In HomeView, mark it as complete or skip
3. The medication should now move to the "Completed & Skipped" section at the bottom
